# robotic-arm
Robotic-arm to calcolate different coordinates' angles (Java)

Textual and graphical program to calculate angles associated to the inserted coordinates. 
The code is written using the Object Oriented Java and Java Swing. 
I Recommend NetBeans 11.1, which I used during the development. 
Enjoy! I hope you'll find the code well-written and the program interesting! 
If you need help or you only want to know something more about me or the code, contact me!

The program is in Italian, I hope this is not a problem in usability.

Credits to Mencaroni and Jacopo Beragnoli, my friends and school mates, to have collaborated with me in this project.

This program can be used completely free for learning purposes
